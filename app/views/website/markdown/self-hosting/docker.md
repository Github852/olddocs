These instructions make the following assumptions:
- You've just finished setting up a Linux server (say, Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit) and have installed Docker on it.
- You've configured your security groups to allow for incoming SSH connections from your local IP.
- You've configured a domain name (or subdomain) to point to your server's IP address.
- You've configured the DNS to enable HTTPS for your domain (say, using Cloudflare).

### Getting started

1. SSH into your new server:

    ``` bash
    $ ssh -l {user} {IP to the server}
    ```

2. Update your system:

    ``` bash
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```

3. Install Git:

    ``` bash
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install -y git
    ```

4. Make sure you are in your home directory and clone the Standard Notes Server [syncing-server](https://github.com/standardnotes/syncing-server) project:

    ``` bash
    $ cd ~
    $ git clone https://github.com/standardnotes/syncing-server.git
    $ cd syncing-server
    ```

5. Create `.env.{app|db}.production` files in the project's Docker environment directory:

    ``` bash
    $ cd $PROJECT_ROOT/docker/environments/
    $ cp .env.app.production.template .env.app.production
    $ cp .env.db.production.template .env.db.production
    ```

    Ensure that the `.env.app.production` file contains the below environment variables:

    ```bash
    $ cat .env.app.production
    RAILS_ENV=production
    SECRET_KEY_BASE=use "bundle exec rake secret"
    RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true

    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=db
    DB_DATABASE=standardnotes
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
    ```

    Ensure that the `.env.db.production` file contains the below environment variable:

    ``` bash
    $ cat .env.db.production
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=
    ```

    If you set a password for the root database user under `DB_PASSWORD` in `.env.db.production`, you must set the same password under `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` in `.env.db.production`.

6. Build the services without starting them:

    ``` bash
    $ docker-compose build
    ```

7. Run the `app` service to compile the assets:

    ``` bash
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d app
    $ docker-compose exec app bundle exec rake assets:precompile
    ```

    At this point the precompiled assets are stored in the `public/`
    folder of the host. The Nginx container will mount the folder as a volume
    and get the assets.

    ``` bash
    $ docker-compose down
    ```

8. Start the services:

    ``` bash
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
    ```

9. Login to the `app` service to initialize the project:

    ``` bash
    $ docker-compose exec app bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate
    ```

10. Access the server locally:

    ``` bash
    $ curl {domain name}
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      ...
      <body>
        <h1> Hi! You're not supposed to be here. </h1>

        <p> You might be looking for the <a href="https://app.standardnotes.org"> Standard Notes Web App</a> or the main <a href="https://standardnotes.org"> Standard Notes Website</a>. </p>

      </body>
    </html>
    ```

11. You're done!
